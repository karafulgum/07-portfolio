            <div class="post__content">
              <p>Starting this day I knew I was going to have some trouble, because I struggled a little bit with the box model during pre-work. Following along in class really helped explain the differences between padding and margin though, which were what I was having trouble with the most.</p>
              <p>The box model assignement really helped me grasp all of the concepts. It took a couple of tries of regrouping and trying different things out, but I finally got it. Plus, it was fun to look at some popular GitHub users.</p>

              <p>It's been a week and a half since we first learned about grids and I'm finally understanding how they work! The thing that tripped me up the most was figuring out the exact grouping needed for grids, but now that I have that done I feel like I better understand how to make one.</p>
              <p>The next day, we learned display flex which also made making grids easier so we didn't have to use floats. Display flex was another concept that took me a little bit to grasp, but once I did everything clicked.</p>

            </div>
            <div class="post__content">
              <p>Just when I had gotten comforatble SASS was introduced. I first struggled with this because I didn't have my grouping names down so when I went to style in CSS everything was all over the place.</p>
              <p>I definitely see where SASS is useful though. It helps to break out each block into it's own scss file so you don't have lines and lines of code to look through just to find one thing.</p>

            </div>
            <div class="post__content">
              <p>I always wondered how you can optimize your site for different device sizes and media queries answered that question. It's really cool to add one in, make some edits and see all the different things you can do.</p>
              <p>We also worked on our class names this day. This was something I've really been struggling with. I didn't understand where to use a double underscore and where to use a double dash. This day really helped to clear that up.</p>
