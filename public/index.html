            <p>HTML Introduction</p>
            <p>In this assignment we had to go through all of the HTML and CSS syntax and find errors. With this being our first assignment, it was a great way to see how syntax should be written correctly. It was a great feeling reloading the page and seeing
              it all come together how it's supposed to.</p>

            <p>Surf And Paddle</p>
            <p>This was our final project for week one where we combined everything we learned about HTML and CSS together. This assignment really helped me to grasp all of the concepts we learned that week. Plus, many websites use this format of a main
              article with a sidebar with a preview of another article as well so it was great to get to code that myself.</p>

            <p>This assignment helped us to understand how to make websites responsive to different device sizes. It was difficult, but it really helped me understand flex boxes more and adding media queries to make the site look the best for each screen
              size. We also learned how to make an element appear when you hover over it.</p>
